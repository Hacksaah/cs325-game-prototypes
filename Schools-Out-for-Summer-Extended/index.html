<h2>School's Out for Summer</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The character's mad dash to leave school on the last day, only to find out that they can never leave...
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Allows users to choose between multiple characters. Game gets progressively harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It is very important to reset your member variables before the game leaves the current state.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from my <a href="https://hacksaah.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Schools-Out-for-Summer/">third digital assignmnet</a></li>
<li>I made the F's spawn a little further away from the characters to give the player a better chance of reacting.</li>
<li>I added a scoring system as well as a level counter.</li>
<li>The game speeds up after every level now.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're trying to make it through the last day of school without failing and getting sent to summer school.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Users can jump with the UP cursor and the "Failings" are generated randomly. As the player progresses through the game, it gets more difficult to evade the F's.
I guess this would be considered a side-view, escape/action game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Smooth transition of difficulty. I didn't want to distract the player while increasing the difficulty of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel the pressure and thrill of having to act in a consistent and precise manner throughout the whole game. The hitboxes on the
"failings" are kind of wonky and hard to avoid if you're inconsistent.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A student is running through the hallways trying to escape and avoid failing on the last day of school. All the player has to do is avoid failing by jumping over the "failings"
with the UP cursor. The player can either play as a male student or a female student and can switch characters after the play or play again as the same character.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No stategy involved. Just good timing and consistency.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A student is trying to get out of school on the last day of school. Unfortunately, failing might keep him/her in school for the summer. So as they try to escape school,
teachers keep dropping work infront of them to do. The student wants to avoid this work at all cost. If the can't, they will get sent to summer school. It is your job
to help make sure the student doesn't get sent to summer school.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Children in grade school who can relate to the feeling of trying to leave on the last day of school.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere from 2 seconds to forever.
</li>
